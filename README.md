# TEdistribute

TEdistribute is a tool for gene ontology enrichment analyses on transposable element (TE) insertions within and between assembled genomes. It requires a standard output table from RepeatMasker (see https://www.repeatmasker.org/) and corresponding genomic fasta and annotation files as input. It then defragments TEs and  performs ontology enrichment tests for insertions in and/or around genes. Enrichment tests can be independently performed on TE families or specific elements.

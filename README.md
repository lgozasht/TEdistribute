# TEdistribute

TEdistribute is a tool for gene ontology enrichment analyses on transposable element (TE) insertions within and between assembled genomes. It requires a standard output table from RepeatMasker (see https://www.repeatmasker.org/) and corresponding genomic fasta and annotation files as input. It then defragments TEs and  performs ontology enrichment tests for insertions within and/or user defined regions surounding genes. Enrichment tests can be independently performed on TE families or specific elements. Tests can be performed either within a genome or, more powerfully, comparatively between genomes of different species to identify potential relationships between specific TE families or general TE distributions and regulation of specific gene networks or processes.
